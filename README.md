# CS 444 - JOS Operating System

This is my implementation of JOS through OSU's CS 444 class. The lab is split into four parts, [as opposed to 6 as described in the original lab by MIT, which can be found here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/overview.html) 
- Booting
- Memory Management
- User Environments
- Preemptive Multitasking (for active user-mode environments)
